# vars Directory

The vars directory hosts scripts that define global variables accessible from Pipeline. The basename of each .groovy file should be a Groovy (~ Java) identifier, conventionally camelCased. The matching .txt, if present, can contain documentation, processed through the system?s configured markup formatter (so may really be HTML, Markdown, etc., though the txt extension is required).
